#An interpreter is a program that reads and runs your Python code line by line, converting it into machine code (the low-level instructions your computer understands).

#✅ Python is an interpreted language — meaning:

#You write your code in .py files.

#The Python interpreter executes your code one statement at a time, instead of compiling it into a separate executable file first (like in C or C++).
